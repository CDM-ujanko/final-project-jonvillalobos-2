Final Project Proposal:

I would like to build an e-commerce website. I think I would like it to be a personal shop where I get to put up things that I own like music records or clothing. It will have a checkout system that uses apple pay, shop, paypal, and card. The database will mostly be login credintials for customers if they chooseto sign up and the products for sale. The front end will simply display what's in stock / available with the prices listedn. It'll just be the product image, the price below it, and a small description. Clicking on you takes you to another page to make the purchase or add it to your cart. Website needs a cart system.
